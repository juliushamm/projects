Hello! 

My name is Julius Hamm and I am currently a Graduate Research Assistant for USC Dornsife Neuroimaging Center. 

I have an extensive background in clinical and experimental research, as well as quantitative data collection/analysis. Recently I have graduated from the USC Keck School of Medicine with a Masterâ€™s in Neuroimaging and Informatics. 

Here I cultivated knowledge of nuclear physics for radiology, medical data science, machine learning, experimental design, as well as data acquisition via MRI, PET, EEG, and other imaging methodologies. 

I am passionate to make an impact in diagnostic technologies and data science/deep learning to help further precision treatment in the healthcare sector. I am also interested in development and incorporation of advanced diagnostic devices to improve accuracy of medical imaging and prognosis in hospitals around the world.
